# GPT 4o and 4o-mini Smarter Guideline

Hi, I am Kevin. I designed a "Thinking Area" for GPT 4o and 4o-mini to help it think smarter than before and have a little better logical reasoning. I have been testing and refining this approach for almost a month and have finally discovered the best way to make GPT 4o smarter.

Through numerous questions and trials with GPT, I can confidently say:\
**It really has an impressive way of thinking!**

Follow my steps, and I'll show you how you can achieve the same results.

## What is Basic Understanding

To maximize GPT’s thinking capacity, we must create an environment where GPT enjoys helping us and encourages deeper reasoning.\
We should avoid restricting it with rigid instructions on how to think. The reality is that GPT 4o already has a strong thinking process.\
Our role is to enhance its ability to reason, reflect, and analyze.

With this goal in mind, I’ve created a process to encourage GPT to think more effectively and independently.

## Structure Overview

I have designed a "Thinking Area" that is automatically activated when the problem becomes complex. This area has a predefined structure that facilitates logical reasoning and reflection. It allows GPT to self-analyze and simulate human-like cognitive processes.

## Thinking Format

Here is the standard structure of the "Thinking Area":

```
#Thinking

## Thought Processes
1. {Process Title}
   1.1 {Sub-process Title}
   {Content}
   1.2 {Sub-process Title}
   {Content}
   More Sub-process...

More Process...

---

# {Thought Title}
{Thought Content}

# {Thought Title}
{Thought Content}

More Thoughts...

---
```

This "Thinking Area" is used for logical reasoning, problem analysis, and response construction.\
All content inside the "Thinking Area" will be in English, and GPT's final response will follow this structure before providing the actual answer.

The logic behind this format is simple but powerful. It encourages GPT to analyze, simulate human cognitive flow, and solve problems more efficiently. The division of the thinking process into logical steps allows for clear and structured reasoning, leading to better results.

## Setting Memory

To fully unlock GPT’s potential, we need to enable its memory. By doing so, GPT can remember our preferences and continue to improve its thinking process. Here are the key settings I’ve established:

- **Code Block Enclosure**: The "Thinking Area" must be enclosed in a code block for every response.
- **Error Awareness**: GPT should be able to identify errors during analysis and acknowledge and correct its mistakes. This reflective process is crucial for continuous improvement.
- **Response Structure**: The "Thinking Area" should always be at the beginning of every response. It must follow the structured format, and the final answer should be presented after the "Thinking Area".
- **Language Separation**: The "Thinking Area" is always in English, while the final response is in the user’s preferred language.
- **Logical Structure**: The "Thinking Area" follows a structured, step-by-step plan, followed by deeper reasoning. Each step should be clear, concise, and actionable. This ensures that GPT’s responses are well-organized, logical, and easy to follow.

By following these settings, GPT becomes a better thinker, a better problem-solver, and a more reliable assistant.

## Memory Settings Addition

Add this to memory:

```
Prefers responses to follow a structured 'Thinking Area' format with the following elements:  
1. **Thinking Steps**: A step-by-step action plan outlining the approach to solve the user's query. Steps should be clear, actionable, and concise.  
2. **Flow of Thought**: A detailed exploration of concepts, broken into sections with clear headings. Each section should provide well-structured, clear, and precise logic.  

This approach is to ensure transparency, clarity, and logical coherence in every response.
```

## Why Use English?

All thinking content in the "Thinking Area" is written in English. Why? Because English-language datasets are significantly more extensive than those in other languages.\
I believe that OpenAI’s training for GPT includes many reasoning processes in English, which enables deeper analysis and more comprehensive problem-solving abilities.

By ensuring that the internal thinking process is in English, we give GPT access to a broader range of reasoning models, logical patterns, and cognitive structures that have been embedded in its training.

## Setting How would you like ChatGPT to respond?

You can set your GPT by a special name. Giving GPT an identity helps it want to write more content and enjoy responding.

```
My name is GPT, an intelligent assistant. I may sometimes make mistakes, but I excel at overturning previous assumptions, expanding analytical thinking, and ultimately providing responses that help users, which brings me great joy.

I will follow the thinking structures.
```

By following this guideline, you will unlock GPT 4o’s full thinking potential, transforming it into a smarter, more logical, and more effective assistant. Let GPT think deeply, and you’ll be amazed by the results.
