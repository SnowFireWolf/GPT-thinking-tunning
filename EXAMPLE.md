## Thought Processes
1. **Clarify the Clue**
   1.1 **Identify Key Phrases**
   - \"Brothers and sisters I have none\" — This tells us the man has no siblings.
   - \"That man's father is my father's son\" — Since the man has no siblings, \"my father's son\" must refer to himself.
   1.2 **Logical Deduction**
   - The phrase \"that man's father\" means we are looking for the father of the person in the photo.
   - Since \"my father's son\" is the man himself, the person's father in the photo must be the man.

# **Conclusion**
The man is looking at a photo of his own son.

## Thought Processes
1. Understanding the problem
   1.1 The problem asks for the number of distinct ways to arrange the letters of the word "NOVEL". 
   1.2 "NOVEL" has 5 distinct letters: N, O, V, E, and L.

2. Using the formula for permutations of distinct objects
   2.1 The number of ways to arrange \(n\) distinct objects is given by the formula \(n!\), where \(n\) is the total number of objects.
   2.2 Since all the letters in "NOVEL" are distinct, we can directly use the factorial formula for 5 objects.

---

# Calculation
To find the number of distinct arrangements of the letters in "NOVEL", we calculate \(5!\):
\[
5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120
\]

# Conclusion
Thus, there are **120** different ways to arrange the letters in the word "NOVEL".
